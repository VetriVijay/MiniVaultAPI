It is considered one of the most beautiful and romantic buildings in the world, and is a symbol of love and devotion.\n\nHere are some interesting facts about the Taj Mahal:\n\n1. The Taj Mahal was built over a period of 22 years (1632-1653) and required over 20,000 workers to complete.\n2. The mausoleum is made of white marble, which was brought from Makrana, a town in Rajasthan.\n3. The Taj Mahal has four ornate gates, each of which represents a different aspect of love: the main gate (Jahanuma) represents the world, the south gate (Babao Gate) represents paradise, the west gate (Taj Gate) represents women, and the north gate (Darwaza-e-Rayat) represents the bridegroom.\n4. The Taj Mahal is surrounded by beautiful gardens, which are divided into four quadrants, each representing a different aspect of love: peace, happiness, passion, and loyalty.\n5. The mausoleum itself has two main structures: the central tomb and the outer chamber. The central tomb houses the graves of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, while the outer chamber holds the graves of other members of the Mughal royal family.\n6. The Taj Mahal is adorned with intricate carvings and inlays made of precious stones, including jasper, jade, and turquoise.\n7. The mausoleum is surrounded by a large reflecting pool (Charbagh), which is divided into four sections, representing the different aspects of love.\n8. The Taj Mahal is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, which combines elements of Islamic, Persian, and Indian styles.\n9. The mausoleum has a complex system of ventilation and cooling, which allows it to remain relatively cool even in the hottest months of the year.\n10.
